# CIERA Extended Mentorship Matching Code

This code was originally written by Alex Gurvich, Tjitske Starkenburg and Aaron Geller, to match mentors and mentees within CIERA.  The code requires input from two surveys, one for mentors and one for mentees.  More information and instructions coming soon!
